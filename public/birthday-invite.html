<p>You are here by invited to celebrate my 25th birthday. The party is fairytale themed, so dress up as your favourite fairytale character.
Food and cakes will be served, and you'll be welcomed with Snowhite's Evil Queen Poisioned Apple Coctail.

<h4>What to bring:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Your spirits of choice (we're gonna get hammered)</li>
    <br />
    <li>Your appetite (you'll be fed until you throw up)</li>
    <br />
    <li>Party mood</li>
    <br />
</ul>
I really hope you have the opportunity to come and celebrate with me. If so, here is where you'll need to be:
