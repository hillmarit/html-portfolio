<h1>The best movies according to Hill-Marit</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Joker</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it is dark and relatable. The ideology presented in the movie is interesting and not far from my personal mindset.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is my favorite sci-fi movie and is also by my favorite movie producer. I love Christopher Nolans ability to mindfuck through film making.</p>

<h3>Midsommar</h3>
<p>This movie disturbed me and to me, it is the definition of the phrase "what the fuck". It's a fucked up movie in a very beautiful and artistic way.</p>
